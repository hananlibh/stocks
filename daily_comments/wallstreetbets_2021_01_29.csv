Here’s a Wallstreet chairman admitting to market manipulation on live TV. The hosts gives him a chance to clarify and he literally double downs on his statement. The entire first half is him reading from a script when they ask him why he halted trading (which is also telling) and in the second half he says it.

Tards, I cannot overstate how important holding will be today. If/When they halt trading. If/When they launch short ladder attacks. If/When they stop all ways for us to communicate. HOLD 💎🙌🏽🌍🚀🌚.

Nobody acts this way if they had nothing to lose. This means that they may be as desperate enough to take the hit this week in order for you to sell and they can buy to cover next week. Yes. They’re that shorted.

This is bigger than us now. Yes. Some higher up WSB chads that are long players are gonna be millionaires. But this is about discovering if we have a free market or not. This will be a catalyst for something. I don’t know what. But something. THEY are actively suppressing trading in a free market because THEY risk losing. L

Fucking HOLD ON 💎🙌🏽💎 Even if it dips to $100< They literally cannot buy enough stock without triggering a MASSIVE/INFINITE price fluctuation. They are that knee deep in shit. If they halt trading, it’ll be scary but they literally cannot buy enough stock because WE’RE NOT SELLING 💎💎💎💎

If your hands start to get itchy because $1,000 seems very tempting for a volatile stock you paid $350< DON’T fucking worry. It’s just the pressure forming your DIAMOND HANDS 💎🙌🏽💎 Don’t forget we are the origin of the squeeze. Everyone joined it a bit later may not fully grasp what we’re doing. If you see regular shmos selling on Twitter because they’re scared don’t worry. They were probably never in until the last day or two and this is probably their first time ever investing to begin with. This is global now, not just WSB. Twitter can be toxic af with everyone vying for a quick viral moment. HOLD 💎🙌🏽💎

Now. Don't worry if we don't squeeze today. Don't worry if we don't squeeze monday. In 2008 the short attack lasted almost 2 trading weeks before the squeeze happened. With shit being frozen yesterday for retail, hedges were able to open new positions. There is a high chance they made a lot of money yesterday. They maybe bought another few days of capital to try to pay the interest on their shorts.

They’re trying to exhaust you and manipulate you AND the markets. We have the upper hand but they’re the abusive person in our lives that have a psychological edge. They have BILLIONS to spend running fake news story’s and holding their position longer than tomorrow. DON’T commit yourself to selling today no matter what. Nobody knows when the short squeeze will squoze. We won’t know if it’s just a gamma squeeze. Just hold. 💎🙌🏽💎 REMOVE ALL SELL LIMITS. EVEN THE ONES THAT YOU SET AT $420.69. It’s not helping our cause. 

Alone 🦍 weak. Together 🦍 STRONG

They don’t know how resolute how we are. How this is our time to stand up to the social and wealth inequality baked into the system we are forced to participate in.

The buying caps that are keeping the price artificially suppressed.  2+2 really is equaling fish right now.  We win if we hold but damn.  I want this win bad.  Not just for the money but what it represents.  I want it for the good its going to bring to thousands of ordinary people's lives.  I want it for the regulation changes that will come.  I want it so we can thumb our nose at Steve Cohen and every other billionaire that sees us as second class citizens.  I want it for the political good will and unity it will bring to this country right now.  That also worries me because I am trading more on emotion than what we are seeing happen in the market.

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

But if you want the god damn change we  have been seeking for decades, here is your biggest shot at exterminating that hornet’s nest. Just hold, don’t give into fear and greed. We must stay unified if this action against corporate corruption.

#2021 IS OUR FUCKING YEAR. AREN’T YOU TIRED OF BEING TREATED LIKE DOG SHIT, AND BANKS USING OUR OWN MONEY FOR THEIR OWN GREEDY PURPOSES WITH THE RISKS WEIGHED ON OUR HANDS.

Ortex data showed that as of Wednesday, there were over $70 Billion dollar loss-making short positions on more than 5,000 U.S. firms. THATS HUGE!!! I AM SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

70,PrimmSlimShady,"Shills out in full force all over reddit claiming the big players here at WSB are gaming the newcomers.

Full disclosure I'm a newcomer and literally only have 2 GME

Thats fucking retarded imo. *Literally everyone* knows the more the bag gets left on the hedges the better the gains. There is *nowhere near* the same profitability in gaming people like us. It's possible I'll end up eating a loss but I don't care. People have had gains of millions and fucking held because they know the squeeze has the real potential, not fucking us over. some little people will likely end up holding the bag as well, but the fact of the matter is that biggest gains come from leaving as much of the bag on the hedge as possible.

I get how cringe this might sound to some and I don't give a fuck.

Ninja edit: remember they literally ***broke the law to try and scare us off this trend*** because they know the fines will be cheaper than their losses. FUCKING HOLD.

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

101,nat20sfail,"# THIS IS THE SHORT LADDER ATTACK

Melvin and his cronies have and essentially always have the ability to coordinate a short ladder attack. With 3% OF THE DAY'S VOLUME THEY DIP THE STOCK 20%! They are trying to catch us off guard and execute a short ladder attack just before close in an attempt to force ITM options to become OTM. THIS WILL SCARE BOOMERS INTO SELLING IF NOT STOPPED. This will also screw over the chances of a gamma squeeze!

BUY THE DIP. Eat up all the discounted stocks and their attack evaporates, and you get in for cheap!

The short squeeze has barely started if at all, and may take days to weeks! The more we keep up pressure, the higher this goes!

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

Yesterday [you took my suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6z7rx/the_hedge_fund_citadel_pays_robinhood_for_their/gl3tlna/) and drove [unbelievable amounts](https://twitter.com/fordm/status/1354856454822486017?s=20) of calls/emails/etc to politicians and offices that needed to hear how pissed off we were that market manipulation was happening in front of all our eyes to protect the rich and fuck the rest of us. 

As of today, several state AG offices have announced investigations, and both the [House Financial Services Committee](https://twitter.com/FSCDems/status/1354901344704991232) and the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/brown-says-senate-panel-to-hold-hearing-amid-gamestop-frenzy) have officially announced hearings into the events around Citadel, online brokers, and Gamestop. 

Pause for a second to understand how insane that is. 

Here's a list of things that haven't received hearings:

* 400k+ covid deaths
* $2k stimulus
* vaccines
* flint water
* Jan 6th capitol events
* healthcare

But in one fucking day we went from many of you saying nothing would happen, to asking me and others for advice on making your first calls to your elected officials, TO HAVING SENATE AND HOUSE HEARINGS ANNOUNCED. THIS IS FUCKING UNPRECEDENTED!!!!

We are 6 million members strong now. As congress moves into these hearings, our voices will be drowned out by massive political contributions from the finance and banking industry, and the same people who manipulated everything yesterday that inspired us to call in the first place.

**If you want to fight back, we have to organize. To organize, I suggest we form a WSB Political Action Committee, and take our fight to DC to make sure our voices continue to be heard.**

If /r/wsb 6mil+ members all gave $10 each to a WSB PAC, we would have $60mil to fight for the common American in DC, and 6 million people ready to make calls and send emails at the first signs of fuckery. Do you understand how incredible it is that yesterday - for the first time in the last four years - members of both parties agreed on the same thing??? 

**We just started. We need to capitalize on that momentum. If you are interested in supporting a WSB PAC and fighting back, I've created wsbpac.substack.com, and wsbpac@gmail.com, to collect contact information for anyone interested. It would take a few days to actually organize a PAC and collect funds, but the time to strike is now while we're all pissed and we have Congress' ears.**

Right now we just need to gauge interest. If enough people are interested we can set formal definitions of the PAC, clearly defined and transparent goals, and meet standard of integrity to ensure money and support is used how it is supposed to be used. It will also give us an opportunity to ask Mark Cuban, Elon, Chamath, and others who have supported this movement in spirit, to now support this movement financially. 

What say you WSB? ARE WE DOING THIS?

Add your email here if you want to keep this conversation going: [wsbpac.substack.com](https://wsbpac.substack.com/p/coming-soon)

And of course, I LIKE THE STOCK AND I AM HOLDING (not financial advice)

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

## clearing firms upped the requirments to 100% effectively killing the amount of shares that any broker can process

## low trading volume = good means people are holding, remember they have banned big players from buying large amounts

## they are posting fud in here to discourage you the short is still 130% ignore it

## robin hood has changed from 5 shares to 2 to only 1 share, this is more evidence we are going to win

## hold until next week, you will be rewarded

**detailed explaination of what is happening**

Clearing firms upped the requirements to 100% to be fronted for every share effectively killing the amount of shares that ANY broker can process.

This is why **Robin Hood** is not allowing people who already have more than the allowed limit of five to buy more shares. This is why they were **begging for money and took out loans**.

Because if they allowed people to buy with no restrictions they would quickly run out of capital again to clear all the stock.

DTCC clearing handles **almost all** clearing for stocks they have risen it for **ALL BROKERS** not just Robin Hood which is why almost **ALL BROKERS** went down yesterday.

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

194,PrimmSlimShady,"Shills out in full force all over reddit claiming the big players here at WSB are gaming the newcomers.

Full disclosure I'm a newcomer and literally only have 2 GME

Thats fucking retarded imo. *Literally everyone* knows the more the bag gets left on the hedges the better the gains. There is *nowhere near* the same profitability in gaming people like us. It's possible I'll end up eating a loss but I don't care. People have had gains of millions and fucking held because they know the squeeze has the real potential, not fucking us over. some little people will likely end up holding the bag as well, but the fact of the matter is that biggest gains come from leaving as much of the bag on the hedge as possible.

I get how cringe this might sound to some and I don't give a fuck.

Ninja edit: remember they literally ***broke the law to try and scare us off this trend*** because they know the fines will be cheaper than their losses. FUCKING HOLD.

197,nat20sfail,"# THIS IS THE SHORT LADDER ATTACK

Melvin and his cronies have and essentially always have the ability to coordinate a short ladder attack. With 3% OF THE DAY'S VOLUME THEY DIP THE STOCK 20%! They are trying to catch us off guard and execute a short ladder attack just before close in an attempt to force ITM options to become OTM. THIS WILL SCARE BOOMERS INTO SELLING IF NOT STOPPED. This will also screw over the chances of a gamma squeeze!

BUY THE DIP. Eat up all the discounted stocks and their attack evaporates, and you get in for cheap!

The short squeeze has barely started if at all, and may take days to weeks! The more we keep up pressure, the higher this goes!

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.
