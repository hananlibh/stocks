Why ? 

Robinhood, Schwab IBKR and the main brokers us millennials use are both making tons of $$ during this vol, but forced to post collateral to clearinghouse as funds settle as a function of vol. This was post in place after 2008 to make sure market participants (HFs, ETFs, etc) can't overleverage, lose $$ on paper and not pay out their losses. Formula for collateral:  \~ 99% 2day VaR

Today the margin call infra is much better. If any of the HFs violated these rules, they'd likely need to post collateral by end of day before an immediate margin call. However RH, Schwab, IBKR etc have no visibility into this, and so NSCC still wants collateral posted to protect YOU. 

Moving to broker xyz is just going to shift the problem to that broker.

207,NoirDior,"A lot of you are asking the importance of closing above 320. Here's why it's (likely) important:

As you witnessed in the last half hour, almost every time we climbed up, we'd be brought back down at the same speed. We experienced a ""ladder attack"" which, to oversimplify it, is these companies selling shares at lower prices and buying shares at lower prices to force the price down. But they're doing this at like insane speeds. 

320 was a major point of resistance for us. We kept getting beat down from there for a while, which makes us assume their ladder was designed to knock us below 320, perhaps even knock us below 300 if our resolve hadn't been so strong. With the market closing above 320, they now have to excercize the expiring options that are profitable up to, and including, the 320 range. They wanted to do what they could to avoid that as to limit their losses. I'm not looking at advanced charts or anything rn, but I'm assuming there must have been a sizable amount of weeklies/FDs that they're now forced to pay out, in addition to every other single option from 320 (330? I forget where we closed lol) and below. 

This is a HUUUUGE dent, and I'd be shocked if we didn't open above 500 on monday.

Shorting hedge fund managers and their progeny now have a cult like worship of black holes. They believe the slow dissolve of their multi-generational wealth to interest rates is their holy birthright. Eventually they, like blessed light, will be absorbed entirely by the One True Lender Bank, and they will come out the other side clean and pure. They must not hasten the process, though, just as light cannot hasten its black hole rebirth. It was born with a direction and held it firmly, for eons.

GME shareholders now live in a caste system. Citizens wear physical symbols of their number of shares, like pieces of flair. Children inherit their parents’ flair, and weddings are arranged so as to strategically join the shares and average price of two families.
